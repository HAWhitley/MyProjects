 Comments Regarding Design:
	This program was designed to parse through an HTML file
	and check if it is balanced or not. If the file is balanced,
	then, the program checks if there are any links. If there are,
	it checks if those links are valid. If so, it adds that link
	to the number of links within that file. It takes the link
	it found and begins the same process with that link.

	This program was designed in C++ on Vim editor. The best way to
	run it is through command line. Simply type 'make' and hit enter.
	Once the program compiles, type './html-test pages/' and whatever
	file you want to input into the program from the pages folder.

	To run all the pages at once, type './html-test pages/*'.
