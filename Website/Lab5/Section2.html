        <b>1. </b> The main function of an unshielded twisted pair cable (UTP) is that it is used in Ethernet 
        based LANs. The one we used in this lab is a CAT5e, which has 4 twisted pairs. It supports 1Gbps up to
        100 meters.
        <br/>
        <b>2. </b>

        The order of the cables with the color code is: <br/>
        1. White/Orange<br/>
        2. Orange<br/>
        3. White/Green<br/>
        4. Blue<br/>
        5. White/Blue<br/>
        6. Green<br/>
        7. White/Brown<br/>
        8. Brown<br/>
        <b>-</b>In order to cross the cables over, you have to separate each cable separately. Then you have to cross
        them in the correct order, which is listed above in order to put the cables in the plastic end piece before
        crimping it.

        The differences between the UTP cable that we used and the other ones are that we used it for networks:
        <table border="1" width="20%">
            <tr>
                <th>Cable</th>
                <th>Transmission Rate</th>
                <th>Shielding</th>
                <th>Max Bandwidth</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cat3</td>
                <td>10 Mbps</td>

                <td>16 MHz</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cat5</td>
                <td>10/100 Mbps</td>
                <td>Unshielded</td>
                <td>100 MHz</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cat5e</td>
                <td>1000 Mbps</td>
                <td>Unshielded</td>
                <td>100 MHz</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cat6</td>
                <td>1000 Mbps</td>
                <td>Both</td>
                <td>250 MHz</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cat6a</td>
                <td>10000 Mbps</td>
                <td>Shielded</td>
                <td>500 MHz</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cat7</td>
                <td>10000 Mbps</td>
                <td>Shielded</td>
                <td>600 MHz</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        So the main differences of these cables compared to the one that we had was that it had different
        transmission speeds and different bandwidths. There are also some cables that are shielded and unshielded
        as well.
