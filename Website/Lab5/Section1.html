        The goal of this project was to be able to connect to another computer
        and then be able to share files with it as well. This skill will be
        useful in the future when working with other people. The motivation of
        this lab was to be able to learn as much as possible.

        The lab setting was basic. There were two computers, three ethernet
        cables, and two routers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Section 2: </b> We will describe how we set up the ethernet cables
        with pictures. We will also be describing the usage of UTP cables as
        well as the differences in other cables other than TCP.
        <br />
        <b>Section 3: </b> This is where we will describe how to install the
        samba server and show the screenshots of my partner and I's samba
        servers connected
        <br />
        <b>Section 4: </b> This describes how we constructed a LAN using one
        switch and how to configure our different IP addresses. We will also
        show how we connected the two together. We will lastly show how we did
        the transmission rate page and make a table to show the data.
        <br />
        <b>Section 5: </b> This will be the same as the last section, except
        with a LAN using two switches. We will do the same experiment and make a
        table for the data.
        <br />
        <b>Section 6: </b> This will be our experimental analysis describing the
        differences between Figure 1 and Figure 2. We will also describe the
        differences in the transmission rates with each section as well.
        Finally, we will be reporting any problems that occurred.
        <br />
        <b>Section 7: </b> This will be our activity log where we make a table
        of what partner did what. This will describe how the work load was
        distributed and the times in which things got done.
