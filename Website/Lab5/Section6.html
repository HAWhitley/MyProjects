        The main difference between figure 1 and figure 2 is the way they are
        connected. Subce we could not get the second experiment to work, we
        could not compare the two experiments

        We could not compare the transmission rates unfortunately but I would
        assume by my knowledge that it would have a longer transmission rate for
        figure two because there are two connections to go through.

        As was mentioned before, we ran into problems submitting the 4GB file in
        figure 1. The solution to fixing this problem was to submit separately
        instead of at the same time. This sped up the process alot and it did
        not give any errors. The next problem we had was in figure 2.
        Unfortunately we could not find a solution to fix the connection problem
        after we fully set up the wires and switches. The main problems we had
        were after we changed the IP address on the second router.
